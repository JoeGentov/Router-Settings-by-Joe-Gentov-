Router Settings — User Guide & Overview

Welcome to Router Settings v1.0.7, developed by Joe Gentov. This program is designed to help you easily manage and configure your router by applying pre-set configurations (presets) and optimizing your network settings.

With this tool, you can:

Restore Default Settings: Quickly reset your router to factory defaults if you want to start fresh.

Apply Optimized Settings: Enhance your router’s performance and security with carefully crafted preset configurations.

Access Router Control Panel: Easily open your router’s admin panel through a simple menu option.

This program is intended for users who want a hassle-free way to manage their router without digging into complex web interfaces or manuals. By following the simple prompts, you can input your router model, choose actions, and update settings like DNS servers, Wi-Fi SSID and password, and router IP addresses with confidence.

Please ensure you have your router’s admin login credentials ready before proceeding. Use this tool responsibly and always back up your current router configuration if possible.
